### Grading My Website: A Step-by-Step Guide

Dear Ms. Metayer,

To grade the website I have created, you will need to follow these steps, as this GitHub repository is a project skeleton I coded, the content still needs to be loaded by the enduser or admin (that's you ðŸ˜‰):

1. **Create a GitHub Codespace:**
   - Visit GitHub and create a new Codespace using the blank template.

2. **Install WASP JavaScript Language:**
   - Open a terminal in the Codespace.
   - Run the following command to install WASP:
     ```
     curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
     ```

3. **Clone the Website Repository:**
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/uniAIDevs/RoaringTwenties
     ```

4. **Navigate to the Website Directory:**
   - Change directory to RoaringTwenties:
     ```
     cd RoaringTwenties
     ```

5. **Migrate Database for Development:**
   - Run the following command to migrate the database for development:
     ```
     wasp db migrate-dev
     ```

6. **Start the Website:**
   - Start the website by running:
     ```
     wasp start
     ```

7. **Access and Review the Website:**
   - Open the popup and navigate to the website.
   - Explore the relevant pages to review and grade the content.
   - Add the articles provided by navigating to the respective pages.

These steps will allow you to access, evaluate, and grade my website effectively. If you encounter any difficulties or have any questions, please feel free to reach out for assistance.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.

Sincerely,
Alex Scott
